received a request for coverage of capecitabine for you. We’ve denied the request for the following
reason(s):

another drug (docetaxel). We have reviewed the information we had. Your request has been denied.
Your doctor can send us any new or missing information for us to review. For this drug, you may have to
meet other criteria. You can request the drug policy for more details. You can also request other plan
documents for your review. Additional coverage criteria may apply, please review policy or plan
documents for full requirements.

An explanation of the full clinical review criteria used in our decision is included in this notice.

are not medically necessary or that are contractually excluded. For a full explanation of the coverage
available, please review your Certificate of Coverage. The Pharmacy Benefit Exclusions section provides
details.

You can request a copy of the contract language by contacting Aetna Member Services. Their toll-free
