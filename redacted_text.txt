Dear ***********,

Community Health Plan of Washington (CHPW) has denied the request for an injection of medication
(called Opdivo).

Clinical Coverage Criteria

ACHPW pharmacist has denied this request using Pharmacy Management (PM) criteria. CHPW uses
plan benefits, guidelines, protocol, or criteria along with medical records of each case to decide
medical need and level of care. The criteria that we used are called PM 119: Nivolumab (Opdivo). A
copy of the criteria used will be provided free of charge upon your request. To obtain a copy, please
contact Customer Service using the contact information below.

Specific Reason(s) for Denial

The criteria must be met to approve this request. The criteria include this medication is to be used
with another type of chemotherapy agent (called fluoropyrimidine such as fluorouracil or capecitabine,
and platinum-containing chemotherapy). The notes sent to us do not show this. The criteria are not
met. This is why the request is denied.

Please talk to your provider about other health care options. A copy of this letter was also sent to your
provider. Your provider may also contact CHPW by calling the Customer Service number below to
speak with the doctor who made this decision.

CHPW can only approve a service for you if it is a Covered Service and we determine it is Medically
Necessary. A service is a Covered Service if it is part of your Apple Health (Medicaid) benefits. We
use the definition of "Medically Necessary" that is in WAC 182-500-0070-Medically Necessary. To
help us determine whether a service is Medically Necessary, we use evidence-based criteria and the
information we get from your provider.

This denial means CHPW will not pay for the service(s). If your provider proceeds with the denied

service(s), they will be responsible for the costs of the service(s). You are not responsible for payment
of the denied service(s) and should not be billed by the provider.
